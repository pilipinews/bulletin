MPD Logistics and Supply Division Chief Superintendent Aquino Olivar stressed on Tuesday during their inventory and inspection of properties the need to add more search and rescue equipment amid the rapid climate change.

As of now, Olivar said that each of the 11 police stations in Manila has only one simple canoe to serve calamity-affected residents from their respective districts.

"Sa Manila ang concern ay baha. Kami kasi sa PNP nata-tap sa search and rescue. Hindi naman kaya lang ng mga NGO. (Flood is Manila's concern. We at the PNP are usually tapped to aid in the search and rescue [operations]. The NGO cannot do this alone," he explained.

Procuring additional weapons, specifically hand guns, are also a must at this time, according to Olivar.

"Marami pa tayong pulis na walang baril lalo na yung mga bago (We have a lot of cops, especially the new ones, who still do not have guns)," he said.

Every year, the MPD, with the help of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO), checks on all its assets including firearms, patrol cars and motorcycles, and buildings, among others.

This is to update MPD's records of its properties to be submitted to the Commission on Audit (COA).

"Marami kasi dino-donate ang city government na minsan nakakaligtaang ilagay sa PNP Property (The City Government has several donations, which we sometimes forget to input on the PNP Property [list]," Olivar said.
