BY JHON ALDRIN CASINAS

Quezon City Police District (QCPD) commended the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for the filling of murder cases against three cops accused of being involved in the murder of Quezon City Chief Prosecutor Regelio Velasco last May 11.

In a statement released on Tuesday, QCPD lauded the bureau, and that the case was now considered "closed and solved."

In a press briefing on Monday, NBI Deputy Director Vicente De Guzman III said the bureau filed murder raps against SPO2 Rodante Lalimarmo, PO1 Jose Mercado and PO3 Arthur Lucy, along with eight other unidentified suspects, at the Quezon City Prosecutor's Office last September 4.

PO3 Lucy, who was assigned at Batasan Police Station 6 at that time, will be ordered to be placed under restrictive custody while administrative cases for Grave Misconduct are being prepared, the statement said.

Investigations showed that Velasco was driving together with his two daughters when suddenly, upon reaching Don Antonio Street, the still unidentified suspects onboard a white Toyota Innova blocked their path and shot Velasco to death.

Meanwhile, QCPD continues to provide security to the family of Prosecutor Velasco to ensure their safety, it said. #
