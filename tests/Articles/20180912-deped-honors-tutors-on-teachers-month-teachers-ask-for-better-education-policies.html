In a press conference, Education Secretary Leonor Briones underscored the important role of teachers and the value of teaching. "I want to say thank you to our teachers who have helped us become who we are," Briones said. "Teaching is a calling and it has to be recognized," she added.

As part of her 10-point agenda for its teaching and non-teaching personnel, Briones reiterated DepEd's commitment "to continuously provide adequate compensation for the invaluable contribution of teachers in the delivery of quality, accessible, relevant, and liberating basic education for all."

Under the fourth tranche of the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) in 2019, a Teacher I with Salary Grade 11 will receive a basic monthly salary of P20,754, with P2,000 worth of personnel economic relief allowance (PERA), a monthly allowance granted to augment government employee's pay due to the rising costs of living.

Teachers' annual benefits also include clothing allowance of P6,000; mid-year and year-end bonuses equivalent to one-month salary each; cash gift of P5,000; productivity enhancement incentive (PEI) worth P5,000; performance-based bonus (PBB) which ranges from 50% to 65% of the basic monthly salary depending on the school's performance; and cash/chalk allowance in the amount of P3,500.

Likewise, Briones noted that teachers receive proportional vacation pay (PVP) equivalent to 70 days during the summer for those who have rendered full services during the school year, and Christmas vacation pay equivalent to 14 days during the holiday break.

Step increment, meanwhile, is the increase in salary from step to step within the salary grade of a position due to the length of service. They also receive loyalty cash incentives depending on the number of years in service (starting on the 10th year amounting to P10,000, and P5,000 after every five years).

Other benefits and incentives include special hardship allowance for those assigned in hardship posts or those who cannot be reached by regular means of transportation through hiking or banca/motorcycle rides, mobile teachers, and multi-grade teachers; honoraria for those teaching overload subject to fund availability; and additional incentives/allowances from the local government unit in selected divisions.

These are on top of the leave privileges, vacation service credits, and social security benefits including GSIS, Retirement and Life Insurance Premiums (RLIP), and PhilHealth (hospitalization, annual physical examination). The DepEd also announced that as a "token of gratitude," teachers may avail themselves of treats from public and private partners that include free entrance to museums as well as discounts in various establishments, among others.

DIGNITY NOT DISCOUNT

Some teachers, however, are not that happy with DepEd's treats. saying that there is nothing to celebrate this NTM because some of the policies that are implemented by DepEd are becoming a burden to teachers.

"We are grateful for these discounts, but we would like to say they are not enough to alleviate our difficulties and to recognize our profession," said TDC National Chairperson Benjo Basas in Filipino.

He said discounts are short-term. "What we need is the immediate removal of policies that make teachers extremely stressful and cause stress and depression, causing job frustration and early retirement of some of our peers," Basas added.

TDC also reiterated its earlier appeal to DepEd to stop the implementation of policies that "steal the time we need to dedicate in the most important work - teaching." More than the discounts, the group said that what the teachers need are "care, concern and love" through policies that will benefit the teachers. "In this way, you might convince us to join in the celebration," Basas ended.

MODEL TEACHERS

Meanwhile, DepEd also lauded four teachers who were conferred as Metrobank Foundation's Outstanding Filipinos for 2018.

Briones said that the triumph of the teacher-awardees is the "triumph of the 700,000 other teachers from all over the country who selflessly embrace the noble mission to nurture and raise holistically developed and lifelong learners."

The teacher-awardees are Mary Jane Ramo, Master Teacher II of Tonggo Elementary School (Tudela, Misamis Occidental); Alma Janagap, Ed.D., Master Teacher II of Pavia National High School (Pavia, Iloilo); Aimee Marie Gragasin, Ph.D., Special Science Teacher V, Philippine Science High School-Cagayan Valley Campus (Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya); and Carla Dimalanta, Ph.D., Professor X, University of the Philippines Diliman (Quezon City).

Amid complaints from various teachers group, Briones noted that there "are so many good things happening simultaneously" in the education sector right now and these should be celebrated as well.
