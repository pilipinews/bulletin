The police identified the suspect as AmelitaSabino, an alleged drug runner of dismissed Police Officer 2 (PO2) Jolly LapuzAliangan, previously assigned to the regional Anti-Illegal Drugs (RAID) Division of NCRPO.

Police said Sabino sold seven packs of suspected shabu to a poseur buyer which led to her arrest.

Recovered from the suspect were seven large packs containing suspected shabu estimated to weigh around 650 grams and P800,000 cash used as marked money.

According to Manila Police Director Supt. Rolando Anduyan, Sabino's arrest revealed that Aliangan is still involved in drug trafficking activities in Metro Manila and Calabarzon.
