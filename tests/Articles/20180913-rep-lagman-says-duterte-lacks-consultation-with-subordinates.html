Oppositionist, Rep. Edcel Lagman of the 1st District of Albay, has mocked President Duterte's alleged lack of consultation with his subordinates when it comes to his recent major announcements.

Fielding questions at the Magnificent 7+'s weekly press conference at the House of Representatives on Thursday, Lagman said this observation seems to be true with regard to the supposed ouster plot against Duterte.

Asked to comment on Duterte's claim that the Liberal Party (LP), the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and supporters of opposition senator Antonio Trillanes IV were plotting his removal from office, Lagman said: "I think there is no consultation between the President and his responsible Cabinet members."

An LP stalwart, the Bicolano congressman was alluding to earlier news reports quoting Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Director General Oscar Albayalde as saying that the supposed ouster move was still being verified.

Yet, Duterte already revealed there was a plan to remove him from office and it would go into high gear next month.

"Kulang sa consultation (There is a lack of consultation)," Lagman stressed, as he brought up another earth-shaking Duterte utterance involving his nemesis, Trillanes.

"Yung secretary of National Defense nagsabi nga, na before he (Duterte) issued that proclamation revoking the amnesty grant to Trillanes (Even the secretary of National Defense said that he was not consulted before Duterte issued that proclamation revoking the amnesty grant to Trillanes), he was not consulted."

Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana had told reporters that he was not consulted by the Chief Executive before issuing Proclamation No.572, which rendered the 2010 amnesty of Trillanes as void.
