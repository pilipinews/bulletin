Chief Supt. Elias Tam Rasco, Police Regional Office-12 director, said multiple murder charges have been filed against Esmael Abdulmalik alias Abu Toraife, the self-proclaimed leader of ISIS-inspired faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and 24 other militants in conne3ction with the two bomb attacks which rock Isulan town on August 28 and September 2.

Rasco said the special investigation task group, headed by Sr. Supt. Oliver Enmodias, police deputy regional director for operations, filed the case against the suspects before the provincial prosecutor's office in Isulan town.

He said the filing of the case against the terror suspects was the result of coordinated efforts among the police, military, and other law enforcement units which shared intelligence information during the case build up to identify the suspects.

Probers were able to establish the identity of the suspected bomber who detonated an improvised explosive device which went off at a flea market in Barangay Kalawag 3 on the night of August 28 which killed three people and injured 35 others.

Police identified the bomb courier as Aladin Mohammad Kikay, said to be a newly-trained bomb expert of the BIFF.

Police said witnesses tagged Kikay as the one who left the backpack which contained the improvised bomb at a used clothes store, or "ukay-ukay" stall minutes before it exploded.

Supt. Aldrin Gonzales, regional police spokesperson, said security forces have launched manhunt operations against the suspected bomber who was believed hiding in Maguindanao.

Investigators have yet to establish the identity of the bomb courier who detonated an IED inside the Prince internet shop in Isulan town on September 2 which killed two people and injured 15 others.
