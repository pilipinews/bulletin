RECRUITER NABBED FOR WITHHOLDING PASSPORT

A female job recruiter was arrested on Wednesday for withholding the passport of an aspiring migrant worker and allegedly extorting money from the victim in Manila. Police Officer 2 Dean Mark Regala, case investigator, said Leilani Geslaya, 47, was arrested at 1:30 p.m. inside a fastfood restaurant on Quirino Avenue corner San Andres, Malate, Manila in an entrapment.

PO2 Regala said Geslaya, who claims to be a freelance recruitment agent, had been in possession of complainant Rosemarie Rodil's passport since February, 2017 when the latter applied as a domestic helper in the Middle East. But Rodil, 42, backed out because she was classified as a "cleaner" in her application. Rodil was also ordered to pay P8,200 for the retrieval of her passport, but could not come up with the money.

"She contacted Lani again (this year). She asked if she could get her passport. But she was told she could only redeem it by paying money.

The suspect said it was still with the agency, making it impossible for her to pull it out since authorization was needed," Regala said in Filipino. Rodil complied with the authorization yet getting her passport back seemed to be out of reach as Geslaya, this time, demanded P7,000 first.

But Geslaya denied the allegation, adding that Rodil knew the agency's policy that she had to pay if ever she would back out.

"It was not my fault. I am no longer part of Jedi Placement Agency, which closed down last January 25, 2018," she said. Geslaya is now detained, facing charges of light coercion, illegal holding of passport, and attempted estafa. (Ria Fernandez)
