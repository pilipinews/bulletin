According to Vy Datul, a witness of the incident, around 7 to 8 teenagers flocked around the jeepney as soon as the vehicle stopped when the stoplight went red.

The group was trying to get a snack from one of the passengers until they started slapping, punching, pulling her hair, and cursing her when she did not allow them to have it.

The victim's companions defended their friend but the teenagers harassed them as well. They also threw water towards the people inside the jeepney.

Other than the snack, the group was able to grab the other belongings of the passengers.

Datul expressed that she would like to help the victims but the driver told them not to interfere.

"Kasi sabi ng driver ng jeep pag 'nakiaalam pa kayo jan, pag bumababa pa kayo jan kayo ang mabubugbug. Marami mga yan' so wala kaming magawa kundi panuorin na lang sila," the witness wrote.

She also shared that the people inside the jeepney urged the driver to stop the teenagers but the driver was not able to confront them.

The incident happened afternoon of September 8, as the jeepney traveled from SM Mall of Asia.
