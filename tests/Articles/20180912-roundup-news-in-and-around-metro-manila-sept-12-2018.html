300 KILOS OF 'BOTCHA', 'LECHON' SEIZE IN TONDO

About 300 kilos of 'botcha' or mishandled frozen meat and 'lechon' or roast pork were confiscated by Manila Veterinary Inspection Board (MVIB) from ambulant vendors in Tondo, Manila on Tuesday early morning.

Dominador Boza, of legal age, was arrested while his two companions escaped, police said.

Personnel from the MVIB and Manila Police District (MPD) police officers seized at least 300 kilos of the meat from ambulant vendors along the corner of Ylaya Street and C.M. Recto Avenue at around 3 a.m. on Tuesday after receiving a tip.

Authorities said a kilo of lechon was sold for P180 while the mishandled meat were packed in plastic and were sold at a comparatively lower price.

VIB special enforcement squad chief Dr. Nick Santos Jr. said eating 'botcha', which comes from animals that died of disease, is harmful to one's health as it may cause diarrhea, food poisoning or death.

Santos also warned those selling mishandled meat will stand to face jail time and a fine once caught.

Vendors caught selling mishandled meat may be fined from P100,00 to P1,000,000 and could face imprisonment of six months to 12 years under the Food Safety Act in Meat Inspection Code.

Santos also advised consumers to be vigilant and double-check the meat they are buying. (Erma Edera)
