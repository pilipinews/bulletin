"That was meant to be just a joke- CIA agent daw [I was supposedly a CIA agent) ," Lorenzana said in a text message to reporters in a bid to clarify the President's recent remarks.

Lorenzana, a retired military officer, explained the President had been making the spy joke about him since they started working in the Cabinet last year.

"That was because I stayed in Washington, D.C. for 14 years from 2002-2016," the defense chief said.

Lorenzana explained that he worked at the Philippine Embassy in Washington DC as a diplomat, starting as a defense attach√© and later being engaged by the Philippine government as a special representative for veterans affairs.

"We at the Cabinet do not take those remarks by the President seriously and neither should you," he added.
