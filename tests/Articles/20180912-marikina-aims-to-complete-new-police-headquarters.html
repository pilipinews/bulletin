This was after a groundbreaking ceremony was held Wednesday afternoon to formally start the construction of the said structure in Barangay Fortune, Marikina City.

Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro said the 130 million project funded by the local government will boast a high-rise 8-storey modern building on a 3,500-sqm. land. It can house at least 730 police personnel.

He also considered the project as one of the city's milestones as it will highlight modern facilities such as indoor shooting range and other high-end communication devices.

"Essentially, all these edifices are not mere structures that provide appropriate venue for your various activities, rather these are lasting monuments that symbolizes the responsiveness of the PNP to the mission to serve and protect the people of this eastern part of the metropolis," PNP Director General Oscar Albayalde said in a speech.

Meanwhile, former PNP Chief and now head of the Bureau of Corrections Chief Undersecretary Ronald "Bato" Dela Rosa; National Capital Region Police Director Guillermo Eleazar; and Eastern Police District Director Police Senior Superintendent Bernabe Balba were also present at the occasion.
