Detained Sen. Leila de Lima believes that drug convict Jaybee Sebastian was pressured to plead guilty in a drug case pending before the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court Branch 206.

In case 17-167, the senator is accused of conspiring with Sebastian, former Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) director Franklin Jesus Bucayu, Bucayu's former staff Wilfredo Elli, De Lima's former security aides Ronnie Dayan and Joenel Sanchez, and a certain Jose Adrian Dera to trade drugs inside the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa to allegedly raise funds for her 2016 senatorial bid.

Prosecutors revealed on Sept. 11 that Sebastian pleaded guilty to the charges during his arraignment at the NBP courthouse last Sept. 4.

According to De Lima, Sebastian was pressured by President Rodrigo Duterte's operators to falsely testify against her in exchange for his and his family's safety.

"Not surprisingly, Jaybee Sebastian pleaded guilty due to threats to his life and that of his family. Let's not forget that Sebastian's life was previously placed in danger because he initially refused to testify against me. Kailangan niyang gawin 'yan dahil buhay niya mismo ang nakasalalay diyan," she said.

On Sept. 28, 2016, Sebastian was stabbed by a fellow prisoner during a riot inside NBP's Building 14, a facility housing high-profile inmates. Sebastian, Peter Co and Vicente Sy were wounded while Tony Co died in the attacks.

The stabbing happened days after then Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said Sebastian was unwilling to testify about De Lima's alleged ties to the Bilibid drug trade, the senator's camp said.

According to De Lima's camp, the case was based on complaints filed by two disgruntled National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) officers who were not re-appointed to their desired positions during the term of the senator as justice secretary.

De Lima said Sebastian has nothing to lose with his admission of guilt, saying that "since he is already convicted of another crime, Sebastian's admission of guilt in relation to the drug charge will have no effect in him. The fear now is if he will live - if he recants."

Filibon Tacardon, De Lima's legal counsel, said while there was an admission of guilt, prosecutors still need to provide evidence of Sebastian's guilt under the Rules of Court.

"The alleged crime involves the penalty of reclusion perpetua (40 years) and the prosecution is yet to-and is required to- provide the pieces of evidence needed to prove Sebastian's guilt," he said.

During her arraignment last July 27, De Lima refused to enter any plea, prompting the court to enter a "not guilty" plea on her behalf.

"I refuse to enter any plea. I don't recognize the validity of the charges against me," she told the court then.
