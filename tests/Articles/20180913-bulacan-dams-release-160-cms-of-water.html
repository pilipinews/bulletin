The move is part of preemptive measures to abate severe flooding as focus shifted to the water carrying capacity of Angat, Ipo and Bustos dams in the province.

"I don't ever want to see my constituents to be flooded again at magigising sila na nakalutang sa baha (and wake up floating in the flood)," Sy-Alvarado said. "This can be avoided if we are all ready and there is teamwork with operators of our dams."

He said dam operators announced that they will release water gradually to maintain the stability and draw the reservoir elevation to safe levels.

As of 8 a.m. Alvarado said that the water level in Angat Dam was 206.94 meters., still way below to its spilling level of 210 meters.

The Ipo dam reached its spilling level of 101 meters, while the Bustos Dam was 17.19 meters (spilling level is 17.50 meters), he added.

Meanwhile, the governor instructed Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (PDRRMC) Officer Liz Mungcal to put on alert all city and municipal disaster control teams as well as other disaster and emergency team as Bulacan braces for typhoon Ompong.
