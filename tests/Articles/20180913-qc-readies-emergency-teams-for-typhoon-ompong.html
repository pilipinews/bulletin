He issued the assurance after he directed the advanced deployment of the Quezon City's Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team in critical areas that may be affected by typhoon Ompong.

Following the pre-disaster risk assessment meeting of the Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (QC DRRMC), Bautista included barangay Apolonio Samson as well as barangays along Araneta Avenue in areas where the USAR was prepositioned yesterday.

The QC DRRMC directed the pre-deployment of its rescue teams in perennially flood prone areas, specifically barangays Roxas and Silangan.

Classes in all levels, both public and private, will be suspended on today (Friday) and tomorrow (Saturday) as a pre-emptive public safety measure.

In a meeting with city officials, PAGASA assistant weather services chief Viviene Esquivel appealed to the public to take necessary precautions with the expected rains this Friday.

She added that tomorrow (Saturday) and on Sunday, there will be less rains but there will be strong winds similar to typhoon signal number one.

With this condition, Esquivel said PAGASA will issue a gale warning with the weather condition affecting the Visayas more than Luzon.

The city's Parks Development and Administration Department (PDAD) was directed to trim trees along major thoroughfares.

Isagani Verzosa, chief of the Department of Building Official also directed building administrators to roll-up billboards and tarpaulin signs installed in buildings.

He also asked the construction companies to secure their construction sites and heavy equipment and tower cranes.

The Social Services Development Department will also pre-deploy social workers including the soup kitchen and other items, such as relief goods for the evacuees in the flood-prone barangays of QC.

There are a total of 84 evacuation centers in the six districts of Quezon City.

For rescue and other emergency concerns in Quezon City, residents may dial 122.
