CAMP BANCASI, Butuan City - Nineteen heavily armed members of the Communist New People's Army Terrorists (CNTs) voluntarily gave themselves up to the Army's 1st Special Forces Battalion (1st SFBn) in barangay Mampayag, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon province, military officials reported Wednesday.

The surrenderees were former members of the Guerilla Front 68 (GF 68) of the CPP-NPA North Central Mindanao Regional Committee (NCMRC) operating in Bukidnon and nearby provinces.

The 19 CNTs yielded 38 assorted firearms to Lt. Col. Sergio P. Macarandan, commanding officer of the 1st SFBn last week (Sept. 6).
The command group of 1st SFBn immediately turned over the surrendered firearms to Bukidnon Police Provincial Office (PPO) for proper documentation and safekeeping.

The surrenderees are currently under debriefing while processing their papers for enrollment of the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP), a program of the government that will extend financial and livelihood assistance to rebel returnees.

Brig. General Eric C. Vinoya, commanding general of the Army's 403rd Infantry (Peacemaker) Brigade, on Wednesday lauded the accomplishment of the 1st SFBn. "The surrender of these CNTs shows that we are on the winning condition-especially that Bukidnon has been conferred as 'Conflict-Manageable and Ready for Further Development (CMRFD)' province," the 403rd "Peacemaker" Brigade commander said.

"As long as the local populace's support and cooperation never cease, we are heading towards attaining long and lasting peace," added Brig. Gen. Vinoya, in a statement.

Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ronald C. Villanueva, commanding general of the Army's Northeastern and Northern Mindanao Fourth Infantry (Diamond) Division (4th ID) on Wednesday urged the remaining CNTs who are still in the mountains to "come down now and avail themselves of the government's peace and development program."

"Our field troops are still open to accept our brothers who wanted to avail themselves of a peaceful and productive life," the 4th ID chief added.
