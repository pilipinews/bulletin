Instead of weapons, illegal drugs were seized during a warranted search for guns at the house of a former "kagawad" or village councilman in Pasig City Thursday morning.

The Eastern Police District (EPD) implemented a search warrant issued by Judge Danilo Cruz of Pasig City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 152 against Randy Remudo, 43, of Barangay Caniogan in Pasig for alleged illegal possession of firearms.

The raiding team, accompanied by media, implemented the search of Remudo's residence at 10:30 a.m.

However, instead of finding an illegal firearm, police stumbled over 11 grams of a white crystalline substance suspected to be methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu" which had been inserted inside a plastic pack of cotton buds.

If proven to be shabu, the illegal substance is worth an estimated P22,000.

The plastic pack unwittingly handed over to police by Remudo's mother-in-law, Julieta Concepcion, was placed on top of her sewing machine.

Chief Inspector Ed Rommel Fajutan, who led the raiding team, said Remudo was arrested for recovering the suspected narcotics based on the plain view doctrine or items found incidentally during a search.

Both Remundo and Concepcion disowned the suspected shabu and denied having concealed it in their residence.

However, police said Remudo was included in Pasig City's Drug Watchlist and that he survived an ambush in December, 2016 following an alleged drug deal.

Last January 30, Remundo surrendered to police during Oplan Tokhang.
