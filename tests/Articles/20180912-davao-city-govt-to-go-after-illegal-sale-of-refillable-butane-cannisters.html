In a release, the City Information Office said the Business Bureau was looking at the illegal sale of the products in public markets and sari-sari stores.

Butane canisters are cheap alternatives to LPGs and are much more portable.

However, with unregulated selling, some canisters are being refilled while some have been seen as a cause of fire in residential areas.

Business Bureau chief Marissa Marasigan-Torentera said that the city was already in close coordination with the DOE and security forces in the intensive operations against those violating Executive Order no. 25, series of 2017.

The EO mandates the creation of a multi-agency task force to properly regulate and ensure safe practices by persons and entities handling and/or engaging in businesses involving flammable and dangerous chemicals and other hazardous and toxic substances.

Torentera said that Mayor Sara Duterte is closely monitoring the operation since it involves the safety of the people.

"We regularly conduct operations against those who continually sell refilled butane canisters. If we caught the selling one, we immediately give them a warning," she said.

Even during the inspection of business permits in small establishments, Torentera said that personnel of the Business Bureau also makes sure that the establishment doesn't continue selling the items.

She stressed that those who will be repeatedly caught will face revocation of business permits.

"For now, we give them warnings. But if they will continue to violate the law, we will not hesitate to revoke their business permits," Torentera said.

Torentera explained that refilling a butane canister was hazardous and dangerous to the public since the canister was designed for one time use only.

"Those refilled canisters contain Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), which requires a thicker container for safety. These butane canisters are only made for one time use only," she said.

Refilled canisters with LPG are prone to fire since it is much thinner than the usual container of LPG.

"We should not sacrifice our safety just because the refilled butane canisters are cheaper. It will cost us more harm and damage if we just allow this to happen," Torentera added.
