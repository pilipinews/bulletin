In a press conference Tuesday, Roderico Sulit, spokesperson of the association, said that the rice to be sold are mixed class of 15 and 25 percent broken grains imported from Vietnam and is being made possible in coordination with the National Food Authority (NFA).

He said initially, rice will be sold at the relocation sites in the municipalities of Balagtas on Thursday, Bocaue on Friday, Marilao on Monday, and in the city of Malolos on Tuesday.

Sulit said that each relocation site will have an allocated 150 sacks of rice that will be sold at three to five kilos per consumers

Marianne Pualengco of the Jomaro Rice Mill clarified that the association's move to sell P38 per kilo of rice is part of their efforts to help people in depressed areas to procure affordable rice as the country faces spiraling costs of the staple commodity.

On the other hand, Elvira Obana, NFA-Bulacan manager, said that rice allocations to accredited rice retailers in Bulacan are now boosted by the arrival of two shiploads of rice in Subic Bay that are ready to be unloaded.

The NFA is targeting a 16 percent market participation in the local rice trade in Bulacan with the arrival of the rice shipment and will be distributed to its more than 300 rice-accredited retailers spread throughout the province.

Mayette Sulit of Maunlad Rice Mill said her company is still studying the possibility of providing P39 per kilo rice to depressed areas in Metro Manila.

Sulit added that since the harvest season has now started, rice prices will start to stabilize in the coming weeks and hopefully normal rice situations will be back in October.
