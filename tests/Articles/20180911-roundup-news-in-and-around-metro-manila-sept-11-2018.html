Three men were arrested by San Juan City police on Monday morning after killing their co-player in an illegal gambling game.

By virtue of arrest warrants issued by Judge Genie Gapas-Agbada of San Juan City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 262, suspects John Santiago, 22; Spencer Dela Cruz, 20; and Gozo Lumanas, 19, all jobless, were arrested by authorities while getting off a tricycle around 10 a.m. Monday along Santolan Road in Barangay Corazon De Jesus, San Juan City.

Court records showed that the suspects were responsible for the killing of Cristino Terrano, 37, electrician.

The incident transpired on July 13 when the victim's group of friends suddenly had an argument with the three suspects and two other men while playing cara y cruz (toss coin game) at Isla Compound, Barangay Batis, San Juan City.

The two groups allegedly engaged in a fight but were eventually pacified by other residents. The suspects' group then decided to leave the area where they gambled.

Later that day, Santiago, Lumanas, and Dela Cruz, reportedly went to the house of their friend Dennis Masangcay, 26, and narrated the incident.

Masangcay then led the three suspects along F. Manalo St. in Barangay Batis where they played cara y cruz and confronted the victim, who at that time, was on his way home together with his two male companions.

The suspects ganged up on Terrano and threw punches on his head and on different parts of his body. Meanwhile, the victim's companions managed to escape, leaving him beaten up by the suspects.

Police said the victim bled to death. His cadaver was later on found atop a wooden cart where he was disposed by the suspects.

Few days after the incident, Masangcay was arrested by San Juan City police while the three suspects went into hiding for almost two months.

On Monday morning, the police conducted an operation which led to the arrest of Santiago, Lumanas, and Dela Cruz.

However, the family of the suspects and the wife of the victim had an amicable settlement.

The court then dismissed the case and ordered for the release of the suspects. (HANAH TABIOS)
