In a statement, the Manila government identified Corazon Aquino High School in Baseco, Vicente Lim Elementary School, Almario Elementary School, Villegas High School in Vitas as temporary shelters of people residing in flood-prone or coastal areas.

It is also opening Delpan Sports Complex and another covered court in Barangay 105.

These are on top of Delpan and Baseco Evacuation Centers of the capital city.

"All the necessary equipment including food and water have been stored at the evacuation centers," Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said.

Although "Ompong" will not directly hit Manila, the city will still experience heavy rains as the typhoon enhances southwest monsoon or habagat.
