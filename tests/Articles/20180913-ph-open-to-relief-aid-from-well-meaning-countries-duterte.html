The President said accepting foreign aid would depend on the "severity" of the onslaught of Ompong, which authorities warned could be a potential super typhoon.

"It would depend on the severity of the crisis. If it flattens everything, maybe we need to have some help and if there are countries who are well-meaning," Duterte said during a press conference after meeting with Cabinet members and disaster relief officials in Camp Aguinaldo.

"Pero wala pa naman. It's too early to speculate," the President added.

The President convened a command conference at the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City to ensure government's disaster response amid the approaching typhoon.

A powerful typhoon is expected to make landfall in Cagayan this Saturday, threatening to dump torrential rains in Northern Luzon. Around 4.3 million persons are likely to exposed to the path of the typhoon, according to disaster officials.

As authorities mobilized resources to help communities to be affected by the storm, the President has cautioned authorities to prepare for any eventually, citing Murphy's law that states anything can go wrong will go wrong.

"Actually in a crisis you have to reckon with the Murphy's Law. We have estimates and we have the projections, the reckonings and all but it ain't there until it is there," he said.
