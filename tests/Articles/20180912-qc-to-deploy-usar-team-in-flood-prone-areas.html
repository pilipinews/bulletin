During the briefing, Bautista included Barangay Apolonio Samson as well as barangays plying flood-prone G. Araneta Avenue in areas where the USAR will be prepositioned starting Thursday, where the effect of the typhoon is expected to be felt.

The QC DRRMC also directed the pre-deployment of its rescue teams in perennial flood prone areas specifically Barangays Roxas and Silangan.

As a pre-emptive public safety measure, the local government has suspended classes in all levels, both public and private, on Friday and Saturday.

In the weather forecast of Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Ompong is may reach its peak intensity of around 220 kilometers per hour of maximum sustained winds and gustiness of up to 270 kilometers per hour while traversing Cagayan-Batanes area.

Starting Friday, the state weather bureau said Metro Manila may experience light to moderate rains with chances of occasional heavy rains with occasional gusty winds.

In the same meeting, Parks Development and Administration Department (PDAD) was also directed to trim trees along major thoroughfares to avoid any accidents.

PAGASA said that many trees are expected to be uprooted and many electrical posts may be toppled due to heavy to intense rains and strong winds brought by the typhoon and enhanced southwest monsoon.

The Department of Building Official also asked building administrators to roll-up billboards and tarpaulin signs installed in buildings.

Construction companies were also ordered to secure construction sites and heavy equipment and tower cranes.

Meanwhile, the QC Social Services Development Department will pre-deploy social workers including the soup kitchen and other aids, such as relief goods for evacuees among flood-prone barangays in the city.

As of now, there are a total of 84 evacuation centers among the six districts of Quezon City which are ready to accommodate residents that will be affected by the typhoon.

The QC LGU advised residents to dial 122 for rescue and other emergency concerns during Typhoon Ompong.
