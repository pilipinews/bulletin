(PAGASA / MANILA BULLETIN)

CAGAYAN

In Cagayan, a mass evacuation is being anticipated, according to Secretary Raul L. Lambino, administrator and CEO of the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport in Sta. Ana.

Lambino has put on stand-by CEZA's earth-moving equipment such as backhoes and bulldozers and other vehicles like ambulances and dump trucks for possible evacuation and rescue operations.

A 50-man quick response team is already on alert with 1,000 relief packs, water and other emergency kits available.

CORDILLERA

Baguio City Mayor Mauricio Domogan, also Regional Development Council (RDC) chairman, has enjoined Cordillerans to cooperate with efforts taken by disaster officials such as any need for preemptive evacuation.

"Be ready and alert especially with the possible floodings and landslides due to scattered rains and thunderstorms," Domogan said as he activated emergency response teams down to the barangay levels.

Apayao Governor Elias Bulut said local disaster risk reduction management councils (DRRMCs) already convened for preparations and established good coordination with the local governments units (LGUs) of Cagayan, Ilocos Norte and Isabela on how to respond to events that will unfold as Ompong roars across Northern Luzon.

NO VEGETABLE SHORTAGE

Meanwhile, Benguet Governor Crescencio Pacalso assured that there is no shortage of vegetables from the highland province as a result of the successive monsoon rains that battered the area recently.

He said the prices of vegetables in Metro Manila are controlled by traders and pointed out that any rice in prices is not at all caused by short supply from Benguet - the source of 75 percent or three-fourths of the capital's vegetable consumption.

Traders in La Trinidad Vegetable Trading Post said the cause of the rise in prices is the delay in transportation due to several landslides and the higher-than-usual moisture content in vegetables at this time, which shortens their shelf life to only 3-4 days.

ILOCOS REGION

Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos has issued a liquor ban to ensure the safety of residents and their mobility should they need to evacuate under difficult situtions as Ompong threatens the north.

"Our priority is saving human lives; second, the damage to infrastructure; and third, our agricultural livelihood and our tourist destinations," Marcos said during critical meetings with DRRMCs.

Provincial Social Welfare and Development Officer Lilian Rin also reminded residents of the "lola watch," urging neighbors and families to look out for vulnerable members of their communities.

In La Union, classes in all levels have already been suspended from yesterday until Saturday in all 19 towns and San Fernando City.

In the capital city, Mayor Dong Gualberto also declared the suspension of work for today in both in the public and private sectors, except those in the front line services or those involved in disaster preparedness and rescue operations.

CENTRAL LUZON

The Philippine National Police (PNP) in Central Luzon was raised to full alert status as Signal No. 1 was raised in provinces in the region.

"We are on full alert status and working overtime to ensure availability of resources and personnel for possible disaster response operations," said Chief Supt. Amador V. Corpus, Police Regional Office 3 (PRO3) director.

PRAYER

In Bataan, Diocese of Balanga Bishop Ruperto Santos called on the public to pray for the calming the "super storm."

Bishop Santos urged the public to pray the following:

"Heavenly Father and Loving God, You are the King of all creation. We adore You O Ruler of all nature! We humbly come to You and ask for Your mercy;"

"Deliver us from the dangers of the approaching super typhoon. We know You can calm a storm at Your word, just like what you did on the Sea of Galilee. We beg that you spare our nation from damage and tragedies;"

"Come to the aid of those who are in the typhoon's path so they may stay unharmed. May You pour Your most precious Spirit over our country so that we may be led to safety. Stir our hearts to be generous to those who need help in the days to come. Remind us at all times that even if we end up in the middle of a storm, You are the one holding us in the palm of Your hands. Amen."

RICE STOCKS

The National Food Authority (NFA) here assured that there is sufficient rice stock senough to provide supply to all its accredited retailers in the provinces of Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac and Zambales.

Director Piolito Santos, regional chief of the NFA based in this city, said that there were around 30,000 bags of NFA rice distributed in different provinces in Central Luzon which can be adequately available in the market even if the strong typhoon "Ompong" disturbs the country.

SEA TRAVEL

The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Dalahican sub-station headed Detachment Commander Thomas Lanto announced the cancellation to travel all sea vessels Quezon and Marinduque provinces due to typhoon Ompng.

Also the Quezon Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (PDRRMO) alerted all municipal disaster offices and reminded to observe protocol in disaster.

Relief goods have already prepared as ordered by Quezon Governor David C. Suarez.

The PDRRMO asked to check all disaster gadgets and vehicles use in rescue operations, and reading designated evacuations centers.
