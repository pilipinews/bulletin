ROBREDO STRESSES POWER OF THE BALLOT

BY RAYMUND ANTONIO

If Filipinos are discontented with the government running the country, they have various "remedies" to show their resistance to the Duterte administration, Vice President Leni Robredo said on Wednesday.

This is not through People Power Revolution, but by means of voting in next year's elections.

"Iyong isang malaking remedyo, iyong eleksyon sa 2019. At iyong eleksyon sa 2019, sana doon natin iparining iyong ating mga boses," Robredo said.

(One big remedy is the elections in 2019. And in the 2019 polls, I hope that's where will let our voices be heard.)

"Iyong eleksyon sa 2019, doon natin iparinig iyong resistance natin sa anumang klaseng pang-aabuso, iyong pag-ayaw natin sa uri ng pamamalakad na tila hindi naaasikaso iyong ating ekonomiya, na hindi natutulungan iyong mga mahihirap natin na taumbayan," she added.

(In the elections, I hope that's where we will show the resistance to any kind of abuse, opposition to the kind of governance that does not fix our economy and does not help our countrymen in need.)

The Vice President made the pitch to Filipinos to vote in the 2019 polls when she was asked by media in Tarlac about the possibility for another People Power to happen.

Robredo replied it is "hard" to tell if Filipinos would stage again a revolution to remove Duterte from office.

But she said the 1987 Constitution provides various remedies for people who are no longer satisfied with the government.

The opposition coalition has already bared its initial list of 18 possible candidates for the 2019 senatorial elections.

Among them are former Senator Mar Roxas, former Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr., election lawyer Romulo Macalintal, TV host and actor Dingdong Dantes, former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay, and singer Leah Navarro.

Also included are former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, musician Jim Paredes, former Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman, Manolo Quezon III, former Presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda, and Samira Gutoc.

The other names previously floated were reelectionist Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno, former Quezon Rep. Erin Ta√±ada, Magdalo partylist Rep. Gary Alejano, actress Agot Isidro, and former Akbayan partylist Rep. Barry Gutierrez.
